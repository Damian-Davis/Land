This is the project overview / steps I took (Personal Education)

The Goal of this project it to read and write data from MongoDB Atlas using deno.

I had to import the Oak from work and get Application 

I had to create a router in order for routes to be listened to 

I used methods on the router to get,create & delete notes using function imported from routes.ts 

//MongoDB
I had to connect to MongoDB Atlas by creating a cluster 

Choose Shared cluster

Choose cloud provider and change your cluster name 

I had to create first database user and give it read and write access 

I had to whitelist the ip address to allows network access 

After MongoDB is connected I had to start building the router functions on route.ts 

I had to ensure that all functions were exported at the bottom 

Rest of information is on README.md file
